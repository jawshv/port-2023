## this is a website

everyone should have one.

i don't think of myself as a web dev - but i've spent enough time in the gulag of javascript frameworks, headless CMSs, little custom api's, and rigid blog platforms that i really wanted to touch grass and downsize my personal site to vanilla html, css, and js. she's simple and static and feels very maluable and doesn't depend on *any* packages.

content wise, everything is either raw HTML, json files converted in script via `createElement`, or this blog which is fetched from an array of markdown files using a [tiny conversion library](https://github.com/adamvleggett/drawdown).
