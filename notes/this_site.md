### this is a website

everyone should have one and it should be something you can touch

i've spent enough time in the gulag of javascript frameworks, headless CMSs, little custom api's, and rigid blog platforms that i was desperate to touch grass and downsize my personal site to vanilla html, css, and js

i think generally, i'm trying to spend less time worrying about tools

now this url hosts a simple and static home that feels very malleable and doesn't depend on *any packages*

re: content, everything is either raw HTML, json files converted to html via `createElement`, or this blog which is fetched from an array of markdown files using a tiny (4 KB) .md to HTML [conversion script](https://github.com/adamvleggett/drawdown/blob/master/drawdown.js)

the site is built from this a repo that lives [here](https://github.com/jawshv/port-2023)
